# Web Sniffer

View HTTP(S) Request and Response headers. Find the live version at **[WebSniffer.CC](https://websniffer.cc/)**.

WebSniffer is an online tool for easily making HTTP requests (GET/POST/HEAD) and viewing the responses.

The online web sniffer tool is useful when tracing redirects, affiliated links, doing web or REST development.

This is based off of the online service at Web-Sniffer.Net but doen't reuse any of its code except of the look & feel. Essentially, it's a web-sniffer.net alternative, which is open source and can be also self-hosted.
